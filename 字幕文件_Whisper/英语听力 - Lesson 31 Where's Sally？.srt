00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,140
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,400
Is the cat climbing the tree?

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,500
Where's Sally Jack?

00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,220
She's in the garden, Jean.

5
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:26,979
What's she doing?

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,220
She's sitting under the tree.

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,859
Is Tim in the garden, too?

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,119
Yes, he is.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,299
He's climbing the tree.

10
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,579
I beg your pardon.

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,820
Who's climbing the tree?

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,979
Tim is.

13
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,859
What about the dog?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,939
The dog's in the garden, too.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,579
It's running across the grass.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,599
It's running after a cat.
