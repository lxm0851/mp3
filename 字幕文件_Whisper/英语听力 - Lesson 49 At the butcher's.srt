1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,099
Lesson 49.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,280
At the butchers.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,980
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,480
What does Mr.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,680
Bird like?

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,379
Do you want any meat today, Mrs.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,920
Bird?

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,699
Yes, please.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,740
Do you want beef or lamb?

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,519
Beef, please.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,699
This lamb's very good.

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,659
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,539
What about some steak?

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,199
This is a nice piece.

15
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,619
Give me that piece, please.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,219
And a pound of mince, too.

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,920
Do you want a chicken, Mrs.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,459
Bird?

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,259
They're very nice.

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,699
No, thank you.

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,339
My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,120
To tell you the truth, Mrs.

23
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:09,280
Bird, I don't like chicken either.
