1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:03,119
Listen 91.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,419
Poor Ian.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,780
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,300
Who wanted to sell the house?

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:19,500
As Ian sold his house yet?

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,220
Yes, he has.

7
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,460
He sold it last week.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
Has he moved to his new house yet?

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,179
No, not yet.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,759
He's still here.

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,599
He's going to move tomorrow.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,679
When?

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,479
Tomorrow morning?

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,299
No, tomorrow afternoon.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,759
I'll miss him.

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,959
He has always been a good neighbour.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,239
He's a very nice person.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,659
We'll all miss him.

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,439
When will the new people move into this house?

20
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,019
I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,420
Will you see Ian today, Jenny?

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,619
Yes, I will.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,039
Please give him my regards.

24
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,700
Poor Ian.

25
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
He didn't want to leave this house.

26
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,280
No, he didn't want to leave.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,259
But his wife did.
