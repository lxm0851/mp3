00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:03,279
Lesson 83.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,740
Going on holiday.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,240
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,640
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,059
Where did Sam go for his holiday this year?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,640
Hello, Sam.

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,640
Come in.

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,580
Hi, Sam.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,100
We're having lunch.

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,780
Do you want to have lunch with us?

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,879
No, thank you, Tom.

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,019
I've already had lunch.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,119
I had lunch at half past twelve.

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,259
Have a cup of coffee then.

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,119
I've just had a cup, thank you.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,519
I had one after my lunch.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,079
Let's go into the living room, Carol.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,079
We can have our coffee there.

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,019
Excuse the mess, Sam.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,299
This room's very untidy.

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,719
We're packing our suitcases.

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,600
We're going to leave tomorrow.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,219
Tom and I are going to have a holiday.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,599
Aren't you lucky?

25
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,179
When are you going to have a holiday, Sam?

26
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,200
I don't know.

27
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,500
I've already had my holiday this year.

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,119
Where did you go?

29
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,579
I stayed at home.
