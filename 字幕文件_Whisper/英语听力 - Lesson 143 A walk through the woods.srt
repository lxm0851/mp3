00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,120
Lesson 143.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,500
A walk through the woods.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,740
What was so funny about the words on the sign?

5
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,500
I live in a very old town, which is surrounded by beautiful woods.

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,039
It is a famous beauty spot.

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,399
On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,539
Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.

9
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:46,419
Little baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,419
Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,019
What I saw made me very sad.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,439
I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:11,619
The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tires, empty bottles and rusty tins.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,719
Among the rubbish, I found a sign which said, anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted.
