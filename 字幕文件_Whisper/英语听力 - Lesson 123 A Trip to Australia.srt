1
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:04,020
Lesson 123.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,819
A trip to Australia.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,419
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,980
Who is the man with the beard?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,359
Look, Scott, this is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,140
Let me see it, Mike.

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,100
This is a good photograph.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,760
Who are these people?

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,519
They're people I met during the trip.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,820
That's the ship we traveled on.

11
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,199
What a beautiful ship.

12
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,459
Who's this?

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,019
That's the man I told you about, remember?

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,199
Oh, yes.

15
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,219
The one who offered you a job in Australia.

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,919
That's right.

17
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,119
Who's this?

18
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:57,879
Guess.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,799
It's not you, is it?

20
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,419
That's right.

21
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,799
I grew a beard during the trip, but I shaved it off when I came home.

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,640
Why did you shave it off?

23
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,799
My wife didn't like it.
