1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,099
Lesson 89.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,859
For sale.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,660
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,280
Why couldn't Nigel decide?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,780
Good afternoon.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,879
I believe that this house is for sale.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,179
That's right.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,440
May I have a look at it, please?

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,719
Yes.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,940
Of course.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,420
Come in.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,839
How long have you lived here?

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,599
I've lived here for 20 years.

14
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,399
20 years?

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,679
That's a long time.

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,079
Yes, I've been here since 1976.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,339
Then why do you want to sell it?

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,879
Because I've just retired.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,019
I want to buy a small house in the country.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,859
How much does this house cost?

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,179
68,500 pounds.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,519
That's a lot of money.

23
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,619
It's worth every penny of it.

24
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,640
Well, I like the house, but I can't decide yet.

25
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,579
My wife must see it first.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,019
Women always have the last word.
