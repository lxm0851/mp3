1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,860
37.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,620
Making a bookcase.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,980
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,339
What is Susan's favourite colour?

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,740
You're working hard, George.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,140
What are you doing?

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm making a bookcase.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,979
Give me that hammer, please, Dan.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
Which hammer?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,899
This one?

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,479
No, not that one.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,599
The big one.

13
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,699
Here you are.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,519
Thanks, Dan.

15
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:53,659
And what are you going to do now, George?

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,599
I'm going to paint it.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,579
What colour are you going to paint it?

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,579
I'm going to paint it pink.

19
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:08,859
Pink?

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,340
This bookcase isn't for me.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,020
It's for my daughter, Susan.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,019
Pink's her favourite colour.
