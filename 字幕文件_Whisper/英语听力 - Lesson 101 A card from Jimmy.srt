1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:03,599
Lesson 101.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,459
A card from Jimmy.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,940
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,179
Does grandmother seem pleased to get a card from Jimmy?

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,060
Why?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,179
Or why not?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,439
Read Jimmy's card to me, please, Penny.

8
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:33,979
I have just arrived in Scotland and I'm staying at a youth hostel.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,379
Huh?

10
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,099
He says he's just arrived in Scotland.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,140
He says he's staying at a youth hostel.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,799
You know, he's a member of the YHA.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
The what?

14
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,820
The YHA mum.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,979
The Youth Hostile Association.

16
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,019
What else does he say?

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll write a letter soon.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,459
I hope you are all well.

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,280
What?

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
Speak up, Penny.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm afraid I can't hear you.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,740
He says he'll write a letter soon.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,039
He hopes we are all well.

24
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,759
Love, Jimmy.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,599
Is that all?

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,480
He doesn't say very much, does he?

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,759
He can't write very much on a card mum.
