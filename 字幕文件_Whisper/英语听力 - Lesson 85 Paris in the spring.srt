1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,059
Listen 85.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,879
Paras in the spring.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,440
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,880
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,000
At what time of year did Ken visit Paris?

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,920
Hello, Ken.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,560
Hi, George.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,019
Have you just been to the cinema?

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,300
Yes, I have.

10
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,400
What's on?

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,939
Paris in the spring.

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, I've already seen it.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,500
I saw it on television last year.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,619
It's an old film, but it's very good.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,479
Paris is a beautiful city.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,039
I've never been there.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,619
Have you ever been there, Ken?

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,799
Yes, I have.

19
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,159
I was there in April.

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,599
Paris in the spring, huh?

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,759
It was spring, but the weather was awful.

22
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,640
It rained all the time.

23
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,599
Just like London.
