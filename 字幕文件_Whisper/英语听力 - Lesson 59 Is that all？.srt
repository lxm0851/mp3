1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,020
Listen 59.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,120
Is that all?

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,520
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,160
Does the lady buy any chalk?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
I want some envelopes, please.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,120
Do you want the large size or the small size?

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,940
The large size, please.

8
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,619
Do you have any writing paper?

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,980
Yes, we do.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,399
I don't have any small pads.

11
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,239
I only have large ones.

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,500
Do you want a pad?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,899
Yes, please.

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,679
And I want some glue.

15
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:45,859
A bottle of glue.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,739
And I want a large box of chalk, too.

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,859
I only have small boxes.

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,459
Do you want one?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,699
No, thank you.

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,939
Is that all?

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,959
That's all, thank you.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,039
What else do you want?

23
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,039
I want my change.
