1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,119
Listen 19.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,139
Tired and thirsty.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,360
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,640
Why do the children thank their mother?

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,300
What's the matter children?

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,320
We're tired.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,800
And thirsty mum?

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,500
Sit down here.

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,979
Are you all right now?

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,559
No.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,379
We aren't.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,619
Look, there's an ice cream man.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,919
Two ice creams please.

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,219
Here you are children.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,820
Thanks mum.

16
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,839
These ice creams are nice.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,320
Are you all right now?

18
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,439
Yes, we are.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,859
Thank you.
