00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,079
Lesson 97.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,040
A small blue case.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,560
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,640
Does Mr.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,160
Hall get his case back?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,920
I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day.

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,080
Can you describe it, sir?

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
It's a small blue case and it's got a zip.

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,579
There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,779
Is this case yours?

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,739
No, that's not mine.

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,539
What about this one?

13
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,159
This one's got a label.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,619
Let me see it.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,019
What's your name and address?

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,939
David Hall 83 Bridge Street That's right.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:11,700
D N Hall 83 Bridge Street Three pounds 50 pence please.

18
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,619
Here you are.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,439
Thank you.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,640
Hey, what's the matter?

21
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,819
This case doesn't belong to me.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,299
You've given me the wrong case.
