1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,919
Lesson 109.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,519
A good idea.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,140
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,960
What does Jane have with her coffee?

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,280
Shall I make some coffee, Jane?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,780
That's a good idea, Charlotte.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,859
It's ready.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,260
Do you want any milk?

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,800
Just a little, please.

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,359
What about some sugar?

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,259
Two teaspoonfuls?

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,059
No, less than that.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,039
One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,519
That's enough for me.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,839
That was very nice.

16
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,439
Would you like some more?

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,179
Yes, please.

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,719
I'd like a cigarette, too.

19
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,899
May I have one?

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,000
Of course.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,899
I think there are a few in that box.

22
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,779
I'm afraid it's empty.

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,859
What a pity.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,399
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,299
Have a biscuit instead.

26
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,079
Eat more and smoke less.

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,819
That's very good advice.
