1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,040
Listen 39.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,259
Don't drop it.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,460
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,060
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,240
Where does Sam put the vase in the end?

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,580
What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,100
I'm going to put it on this table, Sam.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,800
Don't do that.

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,879
Give it to me.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,159
What are you going to do with it?

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,059
I'm going to put it here, in front of the window.

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,399
Be careful.

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,140
Don't drop it.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,879
Don't put it there, Sam.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,979
Put it here on this shelf.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,600
There we are.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,419
It's a lovely vase.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,379
Those flowers are lovely too.
