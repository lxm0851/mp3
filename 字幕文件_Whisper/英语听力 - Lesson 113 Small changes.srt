1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,739
Lesson 113.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,200
Small change.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,560
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,940
Who has got some small change?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,260
Beers, please!

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,900
To Falga Square, please.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm sorry, sir.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,879
I can't change a Â£10 note.

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,339
Haven't you got any small change?

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,679
I've got no small change, I'm afraid.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,439
I'll ask some of the passengers.

12
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,519
Have you any small change, sir?

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,039
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,500
I've got none.

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,939
I haven't got any either.

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,779
Can you change this Â£10 note, madam?

17
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,959
I'm afraid I can't.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,159
Neither can I.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,239
I'm very sorry, sir.

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,879
You must get off the bus.

21
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,859
None of our passengers can change this note.

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,439
They're all millionaires.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,019
Accept us.

24
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,700
I've got some small change.

25
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,280
Have I?
