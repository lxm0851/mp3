Then answer this question.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,280
What are the Johnson's going to do at the weekend?

Hello.

5
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,039

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,619
Were you at the butchers too?

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,839
I was at the green grocers.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,099
How's Jimmy today?

00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,099
He's very well, thank you.

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,479

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,939

Very well, thank you.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
We're going to spend three days in the country.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,719
We're going to stay at my mother's for the weekend.

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,180
Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the country.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,840
Aren't you lucky?
