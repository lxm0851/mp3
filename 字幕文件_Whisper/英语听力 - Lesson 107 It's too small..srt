00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,940
Lesson 107.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,879
It's too small.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,980
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,980
What kind of dress does the lady want?

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,679
Do you like this dress, madam?

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,699
I like the colour very much.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,979
It's a lovely dress.

8
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,500
But it's too small for me.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,259
What about this one?

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,820
It's a lovely dress.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,320
It's very smart.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,479
Short skirts are in fashion now.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
Would you like to try it?

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,279
All right.

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,579
I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well.

16
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,419
It's smaller than the blue one.

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
I don't like the colour either.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,259
It doesn't suit me at all.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,059
I think the blue dress is prettier.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,140
Could you show me another blue dress?

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,700
I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,679
I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress.

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,459
This is the largest dress in the shop.
