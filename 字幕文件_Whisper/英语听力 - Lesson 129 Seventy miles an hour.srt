1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,160
Lesson 129.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,200
Seventy miles an hour.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,500
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,519
What does Anne advise her husband to do next time?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Look, Gary, that policeman's waving to you.

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,900
He wants you to stop.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,119
Where do you think you are?

8
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,400
On a racetrack?

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,179
You must have been driving at Seventy miles an hour.

10
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,679
I can't have been.

11
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,179
I was doing 80 when I overtook you.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,659
Didn't you see the speed limit?

13
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,099
I'm afraid I didn't, Officer.

14
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,399
I must have been dreaming.

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,179
He wasn't dreaming, Officer.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,799
I was telling him to drive slowly.

17
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,500
That's why I didn't see the sign.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,359
Let me see your driving license.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,640
I won't charge you this time, but you'd better not do it again.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,280
Thank you.

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,679
I'll certainly be more careful.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,439
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,940
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,319
Well, next time, you'd better take my advice.
