1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
Who called out to the thieves in the dark?

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,900
Do you like stories?

4
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,359
I want to tell you a true story.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,879
It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.

6
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:34,279
While my friend George was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,859
After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,899
It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,919
Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,739
What's up?

11
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:51,600
What's up?

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,679
Someone called.

13
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,820
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,339
George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,159
He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.

16
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,079
The thieves had already gone.

17
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:14,480
But George's parrot Henry was still there.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,379
What's up, George?

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,200
he called.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,759
Nothing Henry George said and smiled.

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,239
Go back to sleep.
