1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,159
Lesson 63.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,240
Thank you, doctor.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,140
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,360
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,760
Who else is in bed today?

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,300
Why?

7
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,379
How is Jimmy today?

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,800
Better thank you, doctor.

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,879
Can I see him, please, Mrs Williams?

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,900
Certainly, doctor.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,199
Come upstairs.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,239
You look very well, Jimmy.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,459
You are better now.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,140
But you mustn't get up yet.

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,419
You must stay in bed for another two days.

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,039
The boy mustn't go to school yet, Mrs Williams.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,199
And he mustn't eat rich food.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,199
Does he have a temperature, doctor?

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,000
No, he doesn't.

20
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,839
Must he stay in bed?

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:58,859
Yes.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,559
He must remain in bed for another two days.

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,480
He can get up for about two hours each day.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,379
But you must keep the room warm.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,459
Where's Mr Williams this evening?

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,879
He's in bed, doctor.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,359
Can you see him, please?

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,019
He has a bad cold, too.
