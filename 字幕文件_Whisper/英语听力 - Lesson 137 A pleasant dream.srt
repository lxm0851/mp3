1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,280
Lesson 137.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,459
A pleasant dream.

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:10,620
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,640
What would Julie like to do if she had the money?

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,400
Are you doing the football, Pools Brian?

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,339
Yes, I've nearly finished Julie.

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,460
I'm sure we'll win something this week.

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,060
You always say that, but we never win anything.

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,179
What will you do if you win a lot of money?

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,339
If I win a lot of money, I'll buy you a mint coat.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,359
I don't want a mint coat.

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,339
I want to see the world.

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:57,820
All right, if we win a lot of money, we'll travel around the world and we'll stay at the best hotels.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,539
Then we'll return home and buy a big house in the country.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,380
We'll have a beautiful garden and...

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,519
But if we spend all that money, we'll be poor again.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,599
What will we do then?

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,240
If we spend all the money, we'll try and win the football polls again.

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,179
It's a pleasant dream, but everything depends on if.
