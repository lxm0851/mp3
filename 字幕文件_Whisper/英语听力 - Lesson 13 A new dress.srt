00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,099
Lesson 13.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,580
A new dress.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,480
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,679
What colour is Anna's hat?

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,480
What colours your new dress?

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,439
It's green.

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,580
Come upstairs and see it.

00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,800
Thank you.

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,719
Look, here it is.

00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,339
That's a nice dress.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,779
It's very smart.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,479
My hat's new too.

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,979
What colour is it?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,059
It's the same colour.

16
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,079
It's green too.

00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,859
That is a lovely hat.
