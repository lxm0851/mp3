00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,419
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,740
Is Karen Marsh going to retire, do you think?

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,979
Are you really going to retire, Ms.

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,560
Marsh?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,199
I may.

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,560
I can't make up my mind.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,640
I will have to ask my future husband.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,280
He won't let me make enough of it.

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,759
Your future husband, Ms.

10
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,259
Marsh?

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,539
Yes.

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,259
Let me introduce him to you.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,019
His name is Carlos.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,799
We're going to get married next week.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,759
Look, Liz.

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,899
Here's another report about Karen Marsh.

17
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,799
Listen, Karen Marsh, the latest.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,199
At her London hotel today, Ms.

19
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,140
Marsh told reporters she might retire.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,539
She said she couldn't make up her mind.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,179
She said she would have to ask her future husband.

22
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:11,560
She said her future husband would not let her make another film.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,879
Then she introduced us to Carlos and told us they would get married next week.

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,000
That sensational news, isn't it Kate?

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
It certainly is.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,399
He'll be her sixth husband.

27
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you.
