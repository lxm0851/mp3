1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,099
Listen 99.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,679
Ow!

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,740
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Must Andy go to see the doctor?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,879
Ow!

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,060
What's the matter, Andy?

7
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,859
I slipped and fell downstairs.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,899
Have you heard yourself?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,199
Yes, I have.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,060
I think that I've hurt my back.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,379
Try and stand up.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,619
Can you stand up?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,659
Here, let me help you.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, Lucy.

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,859
I'm afraid that I can't get up.

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,959
I think that the doctor would better see you.

17
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,019
I'll phone Dr Carter.

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,500
The doctor says that he will come at once.

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,099
I'm sure that you need an X-ray, Andy.
