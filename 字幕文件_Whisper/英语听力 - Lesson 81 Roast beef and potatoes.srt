Roast beef and potatoes.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,540
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,320
Why is Carol disappointed?

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,800
Hi Carol, where's Tom?

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,440
He's upstairs, he's having a bath.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,260
Tom?

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,320
Yes?

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,019
Sam's here.

10
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,339
I'm nearly ready.

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,899
Hello Sam, have a cigarette.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,820
No thanks Tom.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,779
Have a glass of whiskey then.

14
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,939
Okay, thanks.

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,439
Is dinner ready Carol?

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,959
It's nearly ready.

17
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,679
We can have dinner at seven o'clock.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,979
Sam and I had lunch together today.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,199
We went to a restaurant.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,719
What did you have?

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,479
We had roast beef and potatoes.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,099
Oh.

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,579
What's the matter Carol?

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,939
Well, you're going to have roast beef and potatoes again tonight.
