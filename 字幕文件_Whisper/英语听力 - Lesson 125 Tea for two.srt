1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:03,960
Lesson 125.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:06,899
T for 2.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,980
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,280
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,280
Does Susan have tea by herself?

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,260
Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,060
Not yet.

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,500
I must water the garden first.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,460
Do you have to water it now?

10
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,580
I'm afraid I must.

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,119
Look at it.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,979
It's terribly dry.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,719
What a nuisance.

14
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,399
Last summer, it was very dry too.

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,839
Don't you remember?

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,399
I had to water it every day.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,359
Well, I'll have tea by myself.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,199
That was quick.

19
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,559
Have you finished already?

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,640
Yes.

21
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,379
Look out of the window.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,119
It's raining.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,140
That means you don't need to water the garden.

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,579
That was a pleasant surprise.

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,399
It means I can have tea instead.
