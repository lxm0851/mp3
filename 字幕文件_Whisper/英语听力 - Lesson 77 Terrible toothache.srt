00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,299
Lesson 77.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,040
Terrible toothache.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,140
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,839
What time of days it do you think?

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,500
How do you know?

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,979
Good morning, Mr.

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:21,859
Croft.

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,699
Good morning, Nurse.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
I want to see the dentist, please.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,100
Do you have an appointment?

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,480
No, I don't.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,379
Is it urgent?

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,919
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,039
It's very urgent.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,679
I feel awful.

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,839
I have a terrible toothache.

17
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:52,939
Can you come at 10am on Monday, April 24th?

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,159
I must see the dentist now, Nurse.

19
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,599
The dentist is very busy at the moment.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,980
Can you come at 2pm?

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,640
That's very late.

22
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,879
Can the dentist see me now?

23
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm afraid that he can't, Mr.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Croft.

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,399
Can't you wait till this afternoon?

26
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,099
I can wait, but my toothache can't.
