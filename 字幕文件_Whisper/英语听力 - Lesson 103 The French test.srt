1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,599
Lesson 103.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,000
The French test.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,220
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,400
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,940
How long did the exam last?

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,179
How was the exam, Richard?

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,199
Not too bad.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,979
I think I passed in English and mathematics.

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,640
The questions were very easy.

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,359
How about you, Gary?

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,140
The English and maths papers weren't easy enough for me.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,419
I hope I haven't failed.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,219
I think I failed the French paper.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,140
I could answer 16 of the questions.

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,299
They were very easy, but I couldn't answer the rest.

16
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,579
They were too difficult for me.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,719
French tests are awful, aren't they?

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,599
I hate them.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,779
I'm sure I've got a low mark.

20
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,119
Oh, cheer up.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,379
Perhaps we didn't do too badly.

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,159
The guy next to me wrote his name at the top of the paper.

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,560
Yes?

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,739
Then he sat there and looked at it for three hours.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,500
He didn't write a word.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,939
Thank you.
