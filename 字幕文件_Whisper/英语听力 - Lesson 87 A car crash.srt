1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,079
Listen 87.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
A car crash.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,819
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,980
Can the mechanics repair Mr.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,980
Woods' car?

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,400
Is my car ready yet?

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,080
I don't know, sir.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,320
What's the number of your car?

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,739
It's L-F-Z-312-G.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,119
When did you bring it to us?

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,959
I brought it here three days ago.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,059
Oh yes, I remember now.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,519
Have your mechanics finished yet?

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,780
No, they're still working on it.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,839
Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,859
Isn't that your car?

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,799
Well, it was my car.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
Didn't you have a crash?

20
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,980
That's right.

21
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,099
I drove it into a lamppost.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,140
Can your mechanics repair it?

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:23,200
Well, they're trying to repair it, sir, but to tell you the truth, you need a new car.
