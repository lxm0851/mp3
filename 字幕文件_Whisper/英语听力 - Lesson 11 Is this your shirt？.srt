00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,919
Is this your shirt?

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,000
Listen to the tape.

No, sir.

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,539
It's not my shirt.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,519
This is my shirt.

00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,699
Tim's shirt's white.

15
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,599
Tim?

00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:53,960
Yes, sir.

00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,579
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,259
Here you are.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,640
Catch.
