1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,240
Lesson 121.

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:06,500
The man in a hat.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,160
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,460
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,780
Why didn't Caroline recognize the customer straight away?

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,780
I bought two expensive dictionaries here half an hour ago, but I forgot to take them with me.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,060
Who served you, sir?

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,879
The lady who is standing behind that counter.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,199
Which books did you buy?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,959
The books which are on the counter.

11
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,439
Did you serve this gentleman half an hour ago, Caroline?

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,539
He says he's the man who bought these books.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,079
I can't remember.

14
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,820
The man who I served was wearing a hat.

15
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,500
Have you got a hat, sir?

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,059
Yes, I have.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,039
Would you put it on, please?

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,340
All right.

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,359
Is this the man that you serve, Caroline?

20
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,500
Yes, I recognize him now.
