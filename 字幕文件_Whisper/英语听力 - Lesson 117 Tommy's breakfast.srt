00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:11,200
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,120
What does she mean by change in the last sentence?

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:25,539
When my husband was going into the dining room this morning, he dropped some coins on the floor.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,600
There were coins everywhere.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,079
We looked for them, but we could not find them all.

6
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:42,320
While we were having breakfast, our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.

7
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,599
He put them both into his mouth.

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,519
We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late.

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,739
Tommy had already swallowed them.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,939
Later that morning, when I was doing the housework, my husband phoned me from the office.

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,120
«How's Tommy?» he asked.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,959
«I don't know», I answered.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,759
Tommy's been to the toilet three times this morning, but I haven't had any change yet.
