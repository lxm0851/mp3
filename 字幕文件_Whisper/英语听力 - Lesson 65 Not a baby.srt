1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,339
Lesson 65.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,960
Not a baby.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,620
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,320
Does Jill take the key to the front door?

5
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,820
What are you going to do this evening, Jill?

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm going to meet some friends, Dad.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,899
You mustn't come home late.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,900
You must be home at half past ten.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,019
I can't get home so early, Dad.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,399
Can I have the key to the front door, please?

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,339
No, you can't.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,299
Jill's 18 years old, Tom.

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,079
She's not a baby.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,779
Give her the key.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,519
She always comes home early.

16
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,679
Oh, alright.

17
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,159
Here you are.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
But you mustn't come home after a quarter past eleven.

19
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,819
Do you hear?

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,859
Yes, Dad.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,039
Thanks, Mom.

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,439
That's alright.

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,899
Goodbye.

24
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,819
Enjoy yourself.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,359
We always enjoy ourselves, Mom.

26
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:19,560
Bye-bye.
