1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,080
Lesson 131.

2
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,839
Don't be so sure.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,060
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,360
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,220
What's the problem about deciding on a holiday?

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,839
Where are you going to spend your holidays this year, Gary?

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,500
We may go abroad.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,559
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,780
My wife wants to go to Egypt.

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,060
I'd like to go there too.

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,699
We can't make up our minds.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,799
Will you travel by sea or by air?

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,399
We may travel by sea.

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,919
It's cheaper, isn't it?

15
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,059
It may be cheaper, but it takes a long time.

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
Don't be so sure.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,019
We might not go anywhere.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,659
My wife always worries too much.

20
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,839
Who's going to look after the dog?

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,719
Who's going to look after the house?

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,759
Who's going to look after the garden?

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,239
We have this problem every year.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,039
In the end, we stay at home and look after everything.
