1
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,299
Lesson 111.

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:06,859
The most expensive model.

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,560
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,580
Can Mr.

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,080
Frith buy the television on installments?

6
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:20,199
How does it work?

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,320
I like this television very much.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,140
How much does it cost?

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,720
It's the most expensive model in the shop.

10
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,839
It costs 500 pounds.

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,559
That's too expensive for us.

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,500
We can't afford all that money.

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,359
This model's less expensive than that one.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,640
It's only 300 pounds.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,399
But of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,879
I don't like this model.

17
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,299
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,759
Can we buy it on installments?

19
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,019
Of course.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,959
You can pay a deposit of 30 pounds and then 14 pounds a month for three years.

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,980
Do you like it dear?

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,120
I certainly do, but I don't like the price.

23
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,599
You always want the best, but we can't afford it.

24
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,060
Sometimes you think you're a millionaire.

25
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,200
Millionaires don't buy things on installments.
