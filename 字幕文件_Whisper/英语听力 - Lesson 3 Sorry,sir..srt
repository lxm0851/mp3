Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,500
Does the man get his umbrella back?

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,060
My coat and my umbrella, please.

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,240
Here is my ticket.

Thank you, sir.

Number 5.

00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,739
Here's your umbrella and your coat.

00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,399
This is not my umbrella.

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,339
Sorry, sir.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,359
Is this your umbrella?

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,119
No, it isn't.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,879
Is this it?

13
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,859
