1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,079
Lesson 41.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,319
Penny's bag.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,480
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,000
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,039
Who is the tin of tobacco for?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,539
Is that bag heavy, Penny?

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,960
Not very.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,539
Here.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,580
Put it on this chair.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
What's in it?

11
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,640
A piece of cheese.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,900
A loaf of bread.

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,859
A bar of soap.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,079
A bar of chocolate.

15
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,159
A bottle of milk.

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,479
A pound of sugar.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,399
Half a pound of coffee.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
A quarter of a pound of tea.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,759
And a tin of tobacco.

20
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,619
Is that tin of tobacco for me?

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,839
Well, it's certainly not for me.
