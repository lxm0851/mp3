00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:04,200
Lesson 139.

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,359
Is that you, John?

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,839
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,800
Which John Smith does Graham Turner think he is talking to?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,620
Is that you, John?

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,640
Yes, speaking.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,560
Tell Mary will be late for dinner this evening.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,859
I'm afraid I don't understand.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,059
Hasn't Mary told you?

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,119
She invited Charlotte and me to dinner this evening.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,119
I said I would be at your house at six o'clock, but the boss wants me to do some extra work.

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,779
I'll have to stay at the office.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,359
I don't know when I'll finish.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,799
Oh, and by the way, my wife wants to know if Mary needs any help.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,219
I don't know what you're talking about.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,119
That is John Smith, isn't it?

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,119
Yes, I'm John Smith.

18
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,679
You are John Smith, the engineer, aren't you?

19
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,399
That's right.

20
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,939
You work for the overseas engineering company, don't you?

21
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,439
No, I don't.

22
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm John Smith, the telephone engineer, and I'm repairing your telephone line.
