1
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:03,739
Lesson 115.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,559
Knock, knock.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,400
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,680
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,040
What does Jim have to drink?

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,359
Isn't there anyone at home?

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
I'll knock again, Helen.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,800
Everything's very quiet.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm sure there's no one at home.

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,420
But that's impossible.

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,240
Carolyn Tom invited us to lunch.

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,379
Look through the window.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,079
Can you see anything?

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,239
Nothing at all.

15
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,619
Let's try the back door.

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,359
Look, everyone's in the garden.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,079
Hello, Helen.

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,339
Hello, Jim.

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,779
Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,600
It's nice and warm out here.

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,179
Come and have something to drink.

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,799
Thanks, Carol.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,119
May I have a glass of beer, please?

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,099
Beer?

25
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,199
There's none left.

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,040
You can have some lemonade.

27
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,879
Lemonade?

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,299
Don't believe her, Jim.

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,659
She's only joking.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,259
Have some beer.
