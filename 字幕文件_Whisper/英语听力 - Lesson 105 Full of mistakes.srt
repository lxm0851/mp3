1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,639
Lesson 105.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:05,979
Full of mistakes.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,660
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,919
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,180
What was Sandra's present?

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,280
Where's Sandra, Bob?

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,859
I want her.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,600
Do you want to speak to her?

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,400
Yes, I do.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
I want her to come to my office.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,600
Tell her to come at once.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,500
Did you want to see me?

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,779
Yes, Sandra.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,599
How do you spell intelligent?

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,339
Can you tell me?

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:49,419
I-N-T-E-L-L-I-G-E-N-T.

17
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,199
That's right.

18
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,299
You've typed it with only one L.

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,399
This letter's full of mistakes.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,199
I want you to type it again.

21
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,059
Yes, I'll do that.

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,019
I'm sorry about that.

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,619
And here's a little present for you.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,739
What is it?

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,060
It's a dictionary.

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,899
I hope it'll help you.
