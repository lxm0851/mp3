1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:12,260
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

2
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,600
Why was the mother embarrassed?

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:25,879
Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party.

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,640
I decided to take her by train.

5
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,899
Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,759
She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,479
Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.

8
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,179
Hello, little girl!

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,439
She said.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,320
Sally did not answer, but looked at her curiously.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,659
The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,079
After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
She then began to make up her face.

14
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,079
Why are you doing that?

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,280
Sally asked.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,039
To make myself beautiful, the lady answered.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,000
She put away her compact and smiled kindly.

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,899
But you are still ugly, Sally said.

19
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,840
Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed.
