1
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:03,239
Lesson 73.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,479
The Way to King Street.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,120
Listen to the tape, then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,300
Why did the man need a phrase book?

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,320
Last week Mrs.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,839
Mills went to London.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,780
She does not know London very well and she lost her way.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,760
Suddenly she saw a man near a bus stop.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,299
I can ask him the way she said to herself.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,239
Excuse me, she said.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,279
Can you tell me the way to King Street please?

12
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,279
The man smiled pleasantly.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,439
He did not understand English.

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,219
He spoke German.

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,439
He was a tourist.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,899
Then he put his hand into his pocket and took out a phrase book.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,439
He opened the book and found a phrase.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,800
He read the phrase slowly.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,480
I am sorry, he said.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,579
I do not speak English.
