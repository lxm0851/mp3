1
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:04,080
Lesson 127.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,620
A famous actress.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,520
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,680
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,600
Who is only 29 and why is it so unclear?

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,279
Can you recognise that woman Liz?

7
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:26,879
I think I can, Kate.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,000
It must be Karen Marsh, the actress.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,679
I thought so.

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,919
Who's that beside her?

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,279
That must be Conrad Reeves.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,339
Conrad Reeves, the actor.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,439
It can't be.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,159
Let me have another look.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,699
I think you're right.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,000
Isn't he her third husband?

17
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,779
No, he must be her fourth or fifth.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,500
Doesn't Karen Marsh look old?

19
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,320
She does, doesn't she?

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,819
I read she's 29, but she must be at least 40.

21
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,939
I'm sure she is.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,200
She was a famous actress when I was still at school.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,060
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,640
Not that long ago.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,799
I'm not more than 29 myself.
