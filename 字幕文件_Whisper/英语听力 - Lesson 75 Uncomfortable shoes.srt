00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,500
What's wrong with the fashionable shoes?

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,339
Do you have any shoes like these?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,940
What size?

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,299
Size 5.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,679
What color?

00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:26,539
Black.

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,559
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,679
We don't have any.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,320
But my sister bought this pair last month.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,559
Did she buy them here?

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,719
No, she bought them in the US.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,739
We had some shoes like those a month ago, but we don't have any now.

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,159
Can you get a pair for me please?

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,079
I'm afraid that I can't.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,699
They were in fashion last year, and the year before last.

17
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,399
But they're not in fashion this year.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,319
These shoes are in fashion now.

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,280
They look very uncomfortable.

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
They are very uncomfortable, but women always wear uncomfortable shoes.
