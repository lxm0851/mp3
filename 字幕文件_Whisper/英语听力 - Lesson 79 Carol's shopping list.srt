1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,199
Lesson 79.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,219
Carol's shopping list.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,760
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,220
What is Carol not going to buy?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,440
What are you doing, Carol?

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,359
I'm making a shopping list, Tom.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,179
What do we need?

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,839
We need a lot of things this week.

10
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,419
I must go to the grocers.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,320
We haven't got much tea or coffee, and we haven't got any sugar or jam.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,000
What about vegetables?

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,820
I must go to the green grocers.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,159
We haven't got many tomatoes, but we've got a lot of potatoes.

15
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,619
I must go to the butcher's too.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,419
We need some meat.

17
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,079
We haven't got any meat at all.

18
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,280
Have we got any beer and wine?

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,579
No, we haven't, and I'm not going to get any.

20
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,980
I hope that you've got some money.

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,019
I haven't got much.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,219
Well, I haven't got much either.
