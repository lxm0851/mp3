1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,079
Listen 43.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,019
Hurry up.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,559
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,900
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,740
How do you know Sam doesn't make the tea very often?

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,280
Can you make the tea, Sam?

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,679
Yes, of course I can, Penny.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,939
Is there any water in this kettle?

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,500
Yes, there is.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,279
Where's the tea?

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,640
It's over there, behind the tea pot.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,479
Can you see it?

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,299
I can see the tea pot, but I can't see the tea.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,500
There it is.

15
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,039
It's in front of you.

16
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,179
Oh yes, I can see it now.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,899
Where are the cups?

18
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,539
There is some in the cupboard.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,480
Can you find them?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,780
Yes, here they are.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,599
Hurry up, Sam.

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,980
The kettle's boiling.
