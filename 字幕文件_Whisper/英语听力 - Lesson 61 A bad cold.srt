1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:02,940
Lesson 61.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,139
A bad cold.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,599
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,839
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,400
What is good news for Jimmy?

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,199
Where's Jimmy?

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,740
He's in bed.

8
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,199
What's the matter with him?

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,560
He feels ill.

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,080
He looks ill.

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,039
We must call the doctor.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,560
Yes, we must.

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,820
Can you remember the doctor's telephone number?

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,259
Yes, it's 09754.

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,019
Open your mouth, Jimmy.

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,279
Show me your tongue.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,519
Say, ah.

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,579
What's the matter with him, doctor?

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,280
He has a bad cold, Mr.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,820
Williams.

21
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,159
So he must stay in bed for a week.

22
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,719
That's good news for Jimmy.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,399
Good news?

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,439
Why?

25
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,280
Because he doesn't like school.
