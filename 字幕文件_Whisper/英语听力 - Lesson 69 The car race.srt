Lesson 69.

00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,439
The car race.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,099
Listen to the tape.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,440
Then answer this question.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,039
Which car was the winner in 1995?

6
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:22,679
There is a car race near our town every year.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,100
In 1995, there was a very big race.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,359
There were hundreds of people there.

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,899
My wife and I were at the race.

10
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,399
Our friends, Julie and Jack were there too.

11
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,379
You can see us in the crowd.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,140
We are standing on the left.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,839
There were 20 cars in the race.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:01,559
There were English cars, French cars, German cars, Italian cars, American cars and Japanese cars.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,959
It was an exciting finish.

16
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,000
The winner was Billy Stewart.

17
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,480
He was in car number 15.

18
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,619
Five other cars were just behind him.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,159
On the way home, my wife said to me, don't drive so quickly.

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,459
You are not Billy Stewart.
